        <h1>CSS Assignment</h1>

        <h3>CSS Introduction	ASP.NET Fundamentals</h3>
        <p>
            In this assignment, you will take a complete HTML page (either the one you made in the HTML fundamentals exercise or the base page provided), and style it using CSS.
            You are not allowed to make modifications to the page – it should be unchanged, with the possible exception of adding classes or ids to elements.
        </p>
        <ul>Required Features:
            <li>All text on the page should use a sans-serif font family. </li>
            <li>The page should be 1024 pixels wide, and be centered on the page, with equal margins to the left and right.</li>
            <li>Give the page the following appearance, using only your own CSS code.  </li>
            <li>(The gray boxes show where elements should be positioned – you do not need them to appear as gray boxes on the page)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <ul>Optional Features:
            <li>The second paragraph of the first article element should be written in bold text, with a blue text colour.</li>
            <li>In the unordered list in the side content, items should appear in alternating colours (green and red, as a suggestion).</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>Code Requirements:
            <li>All the CSS code should come from the same file, and be linked into the HTML file through a link tag – there should be no style tags or style attributes in the HTML file at all.</li>
        </ul>
